# spotify

Spotify is convenient, but it's nice to have a contingency plan. I use this Python script to back up my playlists, just in case.

The script depends of [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) and [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy), which uses [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to retrieve the data.
